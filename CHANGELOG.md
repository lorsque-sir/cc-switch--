### üîÑ Migration Notes
For users upgrading from v2.x (Electron version):
- Configuration files remain compatible - no action required
- The app will automatically migrate your existing provider configurations
- Window position and size preferences have been reset to defaults

#### Backup on v1‚Üív2 Migration (cc-switch internal config)
- When the app detects an old v1 config structure at `~/.cc-switch/config.json`, it now creates a timestamped backup before writing the new v2 structure.
- Backup location: `~/.cc-switch/config.v1.backup.<timestamp>.json`
- This only concerns cc-switch's own metadata file; your actual provider files under `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` are untouched.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development
- Added `pnpm typecheck` command for TypeScript validation
- Added `pnpm format` and `pnpm format:check` for code formatting
- Rust code now uses cargo fmt for consistent formatting
